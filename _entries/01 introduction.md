### _What You Need to Know About Day 2 Operations_

Welcome to the Ingite Managing Azure Kubernetes Service Workshop. In this lab, you'll work through some exercises to better understand how to manage and operate [Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/kubernetes-service/).

If you are new to Kubernetes, start with the [Kubernetes Learning Path](https://aka.ms/LearnKubernetes) to learn Kubernetes basics, then go through the concepts of [what Kubernetes is and what it isn't](https://aka.ms/k8sLearning).

If you are a more experienced Kubernetes developer or administrator, you may have a look at the [Kubernetes best practices ebook](https://aka.ms/aks/bestpractices).
